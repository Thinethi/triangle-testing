# Triangle Classifier Testing (Pytest)

This project demonstrates unit testing in Python using **pytest**.
It tests a triangle classification function to ensure correct behavior
for valid and invalid triangle inputs.

## Project Overview

The triangle classifier determines the type of triangle based on the
lengths of its three sides:

- Equilateral – all sides are equal
- Isosceles – any two sides are equal
- Scalene – all sides are different

The test suite validates correct classifications and checks error
handling for invalid inputs.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Pytest

## Test Coverage

The test suite includes:

- Equilateral triangle tests
- Isosceles triangle tests
- Scalene triangle tests
- Zero and negative side validation
- Triangle inequality violations
- Floating-point values
- Boundary and large number cases
